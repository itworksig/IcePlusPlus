> [!NOTE]
> Ice++ is in active development. Grab the latest build from the [releases page](https://github.com/itworksig/IcePlusPlus/releases/latest).

> [!TIP]
> ✅ **Fully supports macOS 27** — tested and ready for the latest macOS, all the way back to macOS 14 Sonoma.

## Install

1. Download `Ice.zip` from the [latest release](https://github.com/itworksig/IcePlusPlus/releases/latest).
2. Unzip it and move `Ice.app` into `/Applications`.
3. Clear the quarantine flag — releases are ad-hoc signed and not notarized, so Gatekeeper would otherwise block the first launch:

```bash
xattr -d com.apple.quarantine /Applications/Ice.app
```

Then open Ice++ and grant **Accessibility** and **Screen Recording** in System Settings (see [Permissions](#permissions)).

For local development, see [script/README.md](script/README.md).

## Uninstall

Quit Ice++, then drag `Ice.app` out of `/Applications` to the Trash. To also remove preferences, delete `~/Library/Preferences/com.jordanbaird.Ice.plist`.

## Why Ice++?

Too many menu bar icons? On small MacBook screens — especially models with the notch — the menu bar fills up fast and icons get hidden behind the camera housing.

Ice lets you **hide menu bar icons on Mac, organize them into sections, and reveal them when you need them**. It is a **free and open-source Bartender alternative for macOS**, and a drop-in replacement if you are coming from **Hidden Bar, Vanilla, Dozer, or BarBee**.

| Hotkeys | ✅ | ✅ | Limited | Pro only |

## Permissions

Ice needs two grants in **System Settings > Privacy & Security**:

* **Accessibility** — hiding and moving menu bar items
* **Screen Recording** — menu bar item images and the Ice Bar

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **After every update you will need to grant these again.**
>
> Releases are ad-hoc signed, so the app's designated requirement is a pinned
> `cdhash` instead of a stable Developer ID. Each build has a different hash, so
> the requirement macOS recorded when you first granted access no longer matches
> the new binary. The symptom is confusing: System Settings still shows the
> toggle **on** while Ice behaves as though it were denied.
>
> The stale entries have to be cleared before the grant can be re-recorded:
>
> ```bash
> ./script/fix-permissions.sh
> ```
>
> Or by hand: quit Ice, run `tccutil reset Accessibility com.jordanbaird.Ice`
> and `tccutil reset ScreenCapture com.jordanbaird.Ice`, relaunch, re-grant.

Because the builds are ad-hoc signed rather than notarized, Gatekeeper may also refuse the first launch. Right-click the app and choose **Open**, or clear the quarantine flag:

```bash
xattr -d com.apple.quarantine /Applications/Ice.app
```

## Features

**Hide and organize menu bar icons**
Hide items individually or all at once, with an optional "always-hidden" section. Reveal hidden items by hovering, clicking an empty area, or scrolling — with auto-rehide, drag-and-drop reordering, and a separate Ice Bar for notched MacBooks.

**Ice Bar — a second menu bar for notched Macs**
On MacBooks with a camera notch, icons hidden behind the notch become unreachable. The Ice Bar gives hidden icons their own full-width menu bar below, so nothing is ever lost.

**Menu bar appearance and themes**
Custom menu bar tint (solid or gradient), shadow, border, and shape (rounded and/or split).

**Hotkeys**
Toggle hidden sections, the Ice Bar, divider icons, and application menus from the keyboard.

**Lightweight and private**
Launch at login, automatic updates. No account, no telemetry, no subscription — your settings stay on your Mac.

> ✅ **macOS 27 fully supported** — works on macOS 14 Sonoma and later, including Sequoia, Tahoe, and macOS 27. If you need a similar tool for macOS 13 Ventura or earlier, check out [Ice 0.11.x](https://github.com/jordanbaird/Ice/releases).

## Project Philosophy

Ice is built with a focus on **stability, performance, and a smooth user experience**.

Rather than adding features for the sake of having more features, the project prioritizes a small, focused, and reliable feature set. Every feature should have a clear purpose, integrate naturally with macOS, and maintain Ice's simplicity and performance.

Our goal is to make Ice feel fast, predictable, and unobtrusive — a tool that quietly does its job without unnecessary complexity. Ice will always remain **open-source** and **free**.
